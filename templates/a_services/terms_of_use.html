        <h1>Acceptable use policy</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          This acceptable use policy (“Policy”) sets forth the general guidelines
          and acceptable and prohibited uses of the excessiondevelopmentblog.tech website
          (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services
          (collectively, “Services”). This Policy is a legally binding agreement
          between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator
          (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement
          on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have
          the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the
          terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not
          have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this
          agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use
          the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services,
          you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
          the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a
          contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is
          not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and
          Services. This acceptable use policy was created with the help of the
          acceptable use policy generator.
